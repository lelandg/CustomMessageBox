This folder is for application resources such as images and icons.

For custom icons, you would typically add the following files:
- Error.png
- Info.png
- Question.png
- Warning.png

These files are referenced in the CustomMessageBox.xaml.cs file for the standard message box icons.

If the files are not found, the application will generate fallback icons using text characters.
